Smart Beta Exchange-Traded-Funds and Factor Investing.

2 The Factors

Use the data found in ‚Äòfactor pricing data.xlsx‚Äô.

‚Ä¢ FACTORS: Monthly excess return data for the overall equity market, r ÃÉMKT. The sheet also

contains data on five additional factors. All factor data is already provided as excess returns.2

<ol>
<li>Analyze the factors, similar to how you analyzed the three Fama-French factors in Homework 4.
You now have three additional factors, so let‚Äôs compare there univariate statistics. ‚Ä¢ mean

‚Ä¢ volatility

‚Ä¢ Sharpe
</li>
<li>Based on the factor statistics above, answer the following.
(a) Does each factor have a positive risk premium (positive expected excess return)? (b) How have the factors performed since the time of the case, (2015-present)?
</li>
<li>Report the correlation matrix across the six factors.
<ol>
<li>(a) &nbsp;Does the construction method succeed in keeping correlations small?</li>
<li>(b) &nbsp;Fama and French say that HML is somewhat redundant in their 5-factor model. Does this seem to be the case?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Report the tangency weights for a portfolio of these 6 factors.
<ol>
<li>(a) &nbsp;Which factors seem most important? And Least?</li>
<li>(b) &nbsp;Are the factors with low mean returns still useful?</li>
<li>(c) &nbsp;Re-do the tangency portfolio, but this time only include MKT, SMB, HML, and UMD. Which factors get high/low tangency weights now?</li>
</ol>
What do you conclude about the importance or unimportance of these styles?

3 Testing Modern LPMs

Consider the following factor models: ‚Ä¢ CAPM: MKT

‚Ä¢ Fama-French 3F: MKT, SMB, HML

‚Ä¢ Fama-French 5F: MKT, SMB, HML, RMW, CMA

‚Ä¢ AQR: MKT, HML, RMW, UMD For instance, for the AQR model3

4 Extensions

<ol>
<li>In Problem 2.1 we tested three models using the time-series tests (focusing on the time-series alphas.) Re-test these models, but this time use the cross-sectional test, as we did in Homework 4. Unlike in Homework 4, do NOT include an intercept in the cross-sectional regression.

Let‚Äôs use the AQR model in (1) for forecasting excess returns. We will do this at each point in time to build a point-in-time series of forecasts. We will then see how well they perform.

<ul>
<li>The model does not give us any info about forecasting the factors themselves. Accordingly, calculate the ‚Äúexpanding‚Äù mean of the four factors. We will use these as our point-in-time factor premia.5</li>
<li>For each of the n securities, estimate (2) over a window of 60 months. Make sure to estimate theserollingregressionsWITHanintercept.6 Butweonlyneedtosavethebetaestimates.7</li>
<li>For every security, i, and at every month, t (after the first 60), calculate (1) using the point- in-time factor premia and betas calculated in the prior two steps. This is your forecast made

a forecast for t + 1. In order to better align it with our data, shift it ahead a time period.8 So the dataframe of forecasts has been pushed one month later. (The Feb value is now a

4Recall that we found in Homework 4 that the market premium went from being strongly positive to strongly negative when estimated in the cross-section with an intercept.

5You may find the following pandas command helpful: .expanding().mean()

6You may wish to use from statsmodels.regression.rolling import RollingOLS

7This will take longer to compute: we are estimating a multifactor regression at every month in time and for every

security. So we are running roughly T √ó N regressions. 8See .shift() in pandas.

Warning! This calculation will be wrong if your forecasts have NaN values where the benchmark does not. For this reason, it is important to eliminate any date where either series has an NaN value.9 If you are careful about this issue, then you can write the OOS r-squared as a ratio of SSE:

9For instance, if you use the rolling regressions, your initial forecast values will be NaN. But your expanded mean calculation for the baseline will not have any NaN. Thus, it is important to require a minimum number of observations in the expanded mean. Or you can more explicitly enforce that both dataframes have NaNs in the same time periods.
